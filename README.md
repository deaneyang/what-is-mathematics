# Thoughts About Mathematics
      
## What is Mathematics?
        
1. Mathematics is the craft of creating new knowledge from old using deductive logic and abstraction.

2. Mathematics is done within an invisible abstract universe that exists only within our minds.

4. There is only a single universe. Each of us, by necessity, has a unique perspective, but they all fit together in a logically consistent way.

5. It is possible for someone else to give you an incomplete description of a mathematical thought, from which you can reconstruct a complete description of the exact same mathematical thought.

6.  The origin of the mathematical universe is no less mysterious than the origin of the physical one.

7. Mathematics is built, starting from its origin, using only mathematics itself.

8.  Mathematics is immutable. Old mathematics can never be destroyed or modified, unless it was wrong in the first place. Only new knowledge is added.


## Doing Mathematics

1. Doing mathematics is messy, inelegant, and requires more than logic and abstraction.

2. Creating and using mathematics involves conjectures, incomplete conjectures (where one cannot even state precisely what the assumptions or conclusions are), examples, counterexamples, aimless calculations and proofs, trial and error, and other inchoate expressions of as yet uncreated mathematics.

3. The goal of establishing new mathematics using only deductive logic and abstraction is only rarely achieved.
