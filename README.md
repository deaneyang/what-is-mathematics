## An Abstract Description of Mathematics
        
1.            Mathematics is the craft of creating new knowledge from old using deductive logic and abstraction.
1.            Mathematics is done within an invisible abstract universe that exists only within our minds.

            Each of us, by necessity, constructs our own vision of the mathematical universe, and yet we all see the same universe.
          </li>
          <li>
            It is possible for someone else to give you an incomplete description of a mathematical thought, from which you can reconstruct a complete description of the exact same mathematical thought.
          </li>
          <li>
            Mathematics uses itself to build new mathematics.
          </li>
          <li>
            Mathematics is immutable. Old mathematics is never destroyed unless it was wrong in the first place. Only new knowledge is added.

                Using mathematics to create new knowledge that lies outside mathematics is analogous to a carpenter using their tools and skills to build beautiful and often functional objects.

            The origin of the mathematical universe is no less mysterious than the origin of the physical one.

        <ol>
          <li>
            Doing mathematics is messy, inelegant, and often involves neither logical nor abstract.
          </li>
          <li>
            Mathematical knowledge is more than what can be derived from logic and abstraction.
          </li>
          <li>
            Establishing new knowledge using only deductive logic and abstraction is the ultimate goal, but is only rarely achieved.
          <li>
            Mathematics contains conjectures, incomplete conjectures (where one cannot even state precisely what the assumptions or conclusions are), examples, counterexamples, and other inchoate expressions of as yet uncreated mathematics.
